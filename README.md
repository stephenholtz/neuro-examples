# neuro-examples

Repository to organize and document analysis of real and simulated neural data in Jupyter Notebooks.

Useful resources: 

* Jonathan Pillow's [github](https://github.com/pillowlab) and [laboratory](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) pages. Have example matlab code for GLMs and fitting RFs.
* [Analysis of Neuronal Spike Trains, Deconstructed. by Aljadeff et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477016)
* ...and many more I need to add
